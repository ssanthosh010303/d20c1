# Description

The code-first approach in Entity Framework is a method for designing and creating a database by defining the domain model classes in code, without needing to create the database schema manually. In this approach, we start by defining your entity classes, along with their properties, relationships, and constraints. Once you have defined your entities, you create a `DbContext` class that represents your database context and acts as a bridge between your code and the underlying database.

With the code-first approach, Entity Framework generates the database schema based on your entity classes and configurations. You can use migration tools to create and apply incremental changes to the database schema as your application evolves. This approach offers flexibility, as you can easily modify your entity classes and configurations to reflect changes in your application requirements, and Entity Framework handles the synchronization of the database schema accordingly.
